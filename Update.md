   - If grade is valid → Continue with verification
4. Proceed with curriculum matching (only if grade is valid)
5. Final verification decision
```

### 📊 REJECTED GRADE TYPES

- **"S"** - Satisfactory grades are not accepted for curriculum analysis
- **"U"** - Unsatisfactory grades (already rejected, value: 0.0)
- **"I"** - Incomplete grades (already rejected, value: 0.0)  
- **"W"** - Withdrawal grades (already rejected, value: 0.0)

### 🧪 TESTING S GRADE REJECTION

The course verification test now includes:

1. **"Research Methods" with grade "S"**: ❌ REJECTED - "Invalid grade 'S' - this grade type is not accepted"
2. **Even with perfect curriculum match**: The course would match "Research Methodology" perfectly, but is still rejected due to the S grade
3. **Clear rejection logging**: Shows exactly why the course was rejected

### 🎉 EXPECTED BEHAVIOR

- **Courses with "S" grades**: ❌ Always rejected, regardless of curriculum match
- **Courses with valid grades**: ✅ Proceed to curriculum verification
- **Clear feedback**: Users see exactly why S-grade courses were rejected
- **Consistent policy**: S grades are rejected at both extraction and verification stages

The dual PDF analysis tool will now completely exclude any courses with "S" grades from the analysis, ensuring only courses with accepted grade types are considered for curriculum gap analysis.

## 🔗 NEW: CORRECT DUAL PDF FLOW - COMPLETED ✅

### Problem Solved: Incorrect Course Description Flow
The previous implementation was NOT doing what was intended. It was comparing transcript courses (with basic descriptions) directly to Plaksha courses, instead of first matching them to course of study courses and using the rich descriptions.

### ✅ CORRECTED DUAL PDF FLOW IMPLEMENTED

#### **Previous (Incorrect) Flow:**
1. ✅ Extract courses from transcript
2. ✅ Extract courses from course of study
3. ❌ **WRONG**: Verify transcript courses against course of study (but keep transcript descriptions)

- **✅ IMPLEMENTED**: Shows OCR error handling ("Computer Sci Fundamentals" → "Computer Science Fundamentals")
- **✅ IMPLEMENTED**: Visual comparison of transcript vs course of study descriptions
- **✅ IMPLEMENTED**: Real-world test cases with actual OCR errors

### 🎯 CORRECTED WORKFLOW

```
1. Transcript PDF → Extract courses (basic descriptions, possible OCR errors)
   Example: "Computer Sci Fundamentals" - "Extracted from transcript: Computer Sci Fundamentals"

2. Course of Study PDF → Extract courses (rich descriptions, official titles)
   Example: "Computer Science Fundamentals" - "This comprehensive course introduces students to..."

3. ⭐ MATCH & ENHANCE: Match transcript to course of study
   - Handle OCR errors: "Computer Sci Fundamentals" → "Computer Science Fundamentals"
   - Replace description: Basic transcript text → Rich course of study description

4. Enhanced courses → Compare to Plaksha curriculum
   - Now using rich descriptions for better similarity matching
