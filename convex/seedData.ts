        description: "Intelligence requires the ability to search for solutions, represent and reason about the world the agent operates in, use memory to remember past experiences, along with language and perception. In this course, Search Methods in AI, we take up the first of the three activities. Confronted with a new problem the only recourse is to search for a solution.",
