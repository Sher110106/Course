## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Frontend (`src/`)
- **React + Vite:** SPA with modern UI, state management, and tabbed navigation

  - `CurriculumAnalyzer`: Manual entry, course management, and analysis trigger
  - `PDFUploader`: Handles PDF upload, OCR extraction, and transcript management
  - `AnalysisResults`: Displays matched courses, gaps, future challenges, and recommendations
  - `CourseInputForm`: Form for adding/editing user courses
  - `SignInForm` / `SignOutButton`: Authentication UI
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with utility helpers (`src/lib/utils.ts`)
- **Notifications:** User feedback via `sonner` toasts

### Backend (`convex/`)
- **Convex Functions:**
  - `analysis.ts`: Core curriculum gap analysis with multi-layer AI matching
  - `courses.ts`: User and Plaksha course management, queries, and mutations
  - `transcriptData.ts`: Transcript upload, storage, extraction, and status tracking
  - `seedData.ts`: Seeds Plaksha curriculum with course data and embeddings
  - `schema.ts`: Database schema for users, courses, transcripts, curriculum, and analysis results
  - `auth.ts`: Authentication logic and user queries
  - `maintenance.ts`: Admin actions (e.g., regenerate embeddings)
- **AI Integration:**
  - Azure OpenAI for both semantic embeddings and chat completions
  - Vector search for course similarity and gap analysis
  - Multi-layer matching algorithm (Vector + TF-IDF + Semantic)
- **File Storage:** Convex file storage for uploaded transcripts

### Database (Convex)
- **Tables:**
  - `userCourses`: User-entered courses
  - `userTranscripts`: Uploaded transcripts and extracted data
  - `plakshaCourses`: Plaksha curriculum with embeddings
  - `analysisResults`: Stores results of each analysis
- **Indexes:** For efficient querying by user, status, department, semester, and vector similarity

## üîÑ User Flow

### 1. Manual Course Entry
1. **Authentication:** Sign in (password or anonymous)
2. **Course Addition:** Add completed courses with title, description, institution, and credits
3. **Target Selection:** Choose target semester for transfer
4. **Analysis Trigger:** AI matches user courses to Plaksha curriculum, identifies gaps, and predicts future challenges
5. **Results Display:** Comprehensive analysis with recommendations

### 2. PDF Transcript Upload
1. **File Upload:** Upload PDF transcript (max 10MB)

## üõ†Ô∏è Development & Maintenance

### PDF.js Worker Version Management
The application uses PDF.js for PDF processing. To prevent version mismatch errors:

1. **Automatic Updates:** The `postinstall` script automatically updates the PDF worker file when dependencies are installed
2. **Manual Updates:** Run `npm run update-pdf-worker` to manually sync the worker file
3. **Version Consistency:** The worker file in `public/pdf.worker.js` must match the installed `pdfjs-dist` version

**Troubleshooting Version Mismatch:**
- Error: `"The API version "X.X.X" does not match the Worker version "Y.Y.Y"`
- Solution: Run `npm run update-pdf-worker` to sync versions
- Prevention: The `postinstall` script handles this automatically
2. **OCR Processing:** Automatic text extraction using Tesseract.js with PDF.js fallback
3. **Course Parsing:** AI extracts and identifies individual courses
4. **Analysis Selection:** Choose between Vector AI (fast) or Hybrid AI (recommended)
5. **Results Display:** Same comprehensive analysis as manual entry
